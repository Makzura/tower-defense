// CI gate: run every suite and compare against the MEASURED baseline, BY NAME.
//
//   node tools/ci-check.js            gate: names first, totals as a check
//   node tools/ci-check.js --names    print today's failing set, paste-ready
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT JUST "npm test" WITH A ZERO-EXIT RULE. This project ships
// with known failures and says so in AGENTS.md: a wave-schedule assertion, some
// stale fixtures, a `w()` helper that only exists in run.js, and one
// Arcane-Sniper B5 timing drift that predates the checkout. Requiring exit 0
// would paint CI permanently red and teach everyone to ignore it, which is
// worse than having none.
//
// So the gate is REGRESSION, not perfection:
//   * a failing NAME that was not failing before -> fail the build
//   * passes going DOWN                          -> fail the build
//   * a name that stopped failing, or passes going up -> pass, and say so
//     loudly, so the baseline below can be tightened in the same commit that
//     earned it
//
// WHY NAMES AND NOT TOTALS, WHICH IS WHAT THIS FILE USED TO COMPARE. A total is
// a sum, and a sum hides a swap. One test breaking while another is silently
// fixed leaves 30 failures before and 30 failures after, and the old version of
// this gate printed "No regressions" for it -- confidently, in green, which is
// worse than printing nothing. That has happened on this project before: two
// tests named in AGENTS.md as known failures were found to be PASSING, and had
// been passing since before the block that named them was written. Nothing but
// the names could show it. The totals were right the whole time.
//
// The set below is therefore the real baseline and the counts are a
// CROSS-CHECK on the parse, not the gate.
//
// THE PARSE MUST BE ABLE TO FAIL. If a suite's output format changes, a name
// regex that quietly matches nothing would report an empty failing set forever
// and this gate would pass every build for the rest of its life. So every run
// asserts that the number of FAIL lines it scraped equals the count the suite
// reported about itself, and a mismatch is a hard failure with the tail of the
// output attached. A check that can only ever say "clean" is not a check.
//
// The numbers are MEASURED, not copied from the docs. AGENTS.md recorded
// blub.test at 47 passing for weeks; it is 53, and was 53 on the day the 47 was
// typed. A baseline transcribed from prose is a baseline that drifts, which is
// the failure this file exists to catch. Regenerate with --names, never by
// hand.
//
// Measured 2026-08-12 on branch visual-pass, node v24, after the authorised
// fixture repairs: the Arcane-Sniper B5 channel, the gunner-deletion roster
// shift, two renames and the recruit cooldown. 36 standing names -> 23, none
// added. The remaining 23 are the held upgrade retune, the Tyrant, and the
// test-file bugs; see the per-suite notes below.
